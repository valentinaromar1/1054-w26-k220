        <section>
        <p>"I can't really, uh, play the guitar very well
        Um, or sing, so, you know, apo-, apologies"</p>

        <p>Stunning 8K-resolution meditation app,
        In honor of the revolution, it's half off at the GAP.
        Deadpool's self-awareness, loving parents, harmless fun
        The backlash to the backlash to the thing that's just begun</p>

        <p>There it is again, that funny feeling
        That funny feeling
        There it is again, that funny feeling
        That funny feeling</p>

        <p>The surgeon generals' pop-up shop, Robert Iger's face.
        Discount Etsy agitprop, Bugles' take on race
        Female Colonel Sanders, easy answers, civil war
        The whole world at your fingertips, the ocean at your door</p>

        <p>The live-action Lion King, the Pepsi Halftime Show.
        20 thousand years of this, seven more to go.
        Carpool Karaoke, Steve Aoki, Logan Paul
        A gift shop at the gun range, a mass shooting at the mall</p>

        <p>There it is again, that funny feeling
        That funny feeling
        There it is again, that funny feeling
        That funny feeling</p>

        <p>Reading Pornhub's terms of service, going for a drive
        And obeying all the traffic laws in Grand Theft Auto V
        Full agoraphobic, losing focus, cover blown
        A book on getting better hand-delivered by a drone</p>

        <p>Total disassociation, fully out your mind
        Googling <em>"derealization"</em>, hating what you find
        That unapparent summer air in early fall
        The quiet comprehending of the ending of it all</p>

        <p>There it is again, that funny feeling
        That funny feeling
        There it is again, that funny feeling
        That funny feeling</p>

        <p>Hey, what can you say? We were overdue
        But it'll be over soon, you wait
        Hey, what can you say? We were overdue
        But it'll be over soon, just wait, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da-da-da-da</p>

        <p>And hey, what can you say? We were overdue
        But it'll be over soon, you wait, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da-da-da-da
        Hey, what can you say? We were overdue
        But it'll be over soon, you wait, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da</p>

        <p>Hey, what can you say? We were overdue
        But it'll be over soon, you wait, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da-da-da-da....</p>

    <!--a small section about what the song means to me-->  
    <blockquote>
    <h3>what the song means to me</h3>

    <P>that funny feeling is a song that mean a lot to me, because the song is just weridly comforting to listen to every now and again, the lyrics sets the tone of the tone well with what he talks about in the rest of the album</P>

    <p>what the song is from is a netflix special called <strong>"INSIDE"</strong> one of his first time being in front of an audience since he stopped doing in person shows due to extreme anxiety on stage</p>

    <p>the whole point of the show is the fact that the world is falling apart and yet everyone is stuck <em>inside</em> of their own problems and ignoring the outside issues just makes everything that your stuck with even worse</p>

    <p>the song "that funny feeling" really sets a good story of how now matter how you try to distract from the problems, it will always come back to "that funny feeling" that comes with comprehending the fact that the problems are everywhere, and you cant ignore it forever, at least that what it means to me
